    "## Assignment 5: Recommendation System with Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "I LOVE MOVIE corp has been more and more popular since their last collaboration with you. To make more money, just like all the other companies, they plan to build a movie recommendation system for their customers. However, because they are too popular, well, and have plenty of money, they decide to use Big Data engines and build their system on Google Cloud. As their technology counselor, you will fulfill this requirement in this assginment.\n",
    "\n",
    "** OBJECTIVE **:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will implement a movie recommendation system based on the [US patent](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US7908183.pdf) of Amazon.com recommendation system. You will use [item-to-item](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf) algorithm to compute item similarity. All the algorithms will be implement in MapReduce framework we have used in Lab1, while using MongoDB to query the result.\n",

    "** TASKS **\n",

    "1. Process batch data with MapReduce\n",
    "1. Use NoSQL to interact with MongoDB\n",
